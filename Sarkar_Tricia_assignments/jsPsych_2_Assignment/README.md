This code is written by Tricia Sarkar for PNB 3EE3.

myNewExperiment_rt.html is a simple reaction time experiment. The participant needs to install the html file and open it in their browser to run the experiment.

Some modifications have been made to the original "simple reaction time experiment" code for this assignment.
1. The orange circle is half of the original diameter of the .png file it is sourced from. This is done using stimulus_width 
   set to 150 px.
2. The blue circle has been changed to a blue square. I did this by replacing the blue circle .png to a blue square .png file.
3. The instructions have been edited to reflect the change from blue circle to blue square.
4. The code can now calculate the mean reaction time for blue square and orange circle together AND separately.
5. The post-experiment debrief now displays 3 mean reaction time values instead of just 1.
